1 Installation
**************

1.1 Introduction
================

This file documents the installation of the GNUstep Backend Library,
'gnustep-back'.  If you are installing this package as part of the
GNUstep core package, read the file GNUstep-HOWTO for more complete
instructions on how to install the entire GNUstep package (including
this library).  GNUstep-HOWTO is located at <http://www.gnustep.org>

   You must have installed gnustep-gui before installing this library.

1.2 Configuration
=================

Configuration is performed by running the 'configure' program at a shell
prompt.  You may want to use some of the optional arguments to the
'configure' program.  Type 'configure --help' for a list.  GNUstep
specific options are at the end of this list (if any).

   The backend comes with several different window server and graphics
drawing implementations.  If you do nothing, the default ones will be
chosen.  You can can change this using configure.  For instance, to
choose the art graphical drawing implementation, run

     configure --enable-graphics=art

   Type 'configure --help' for a list of graphical drawing
implementations.

   You can also change the name of the backend when configuring it.
This is convienient if you want to have a different backend with
different configurations.  For instance, to create an xlib and and art
backend, you could do this:

     configure --enable-graphics=xlib --with-name=xlib
     make install

     make distclean
     configure --enable-graphics=art --with-name=art
     make install

   Before running an application, choose one backend using the defaults
program:

     defaults write NSGlobalDomain GSBackend libgnustep-xlib

1.3 Compilation
===============

To compile this library, type make.  After this is complete, type make
install (make sure you are the root user).  Some additional options you
can use with make are 'debug=yes' to make a debugging version of the
library and 'shared=no' to make a static version of the library.  See
the gstep-make package for more information on these options.

1.4 Installing
==============

To install, type

     make install
