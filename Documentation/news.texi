@section Noteworthy changes in version @samp{0.10.2}

The Backend can set UTF8 window titles where this is allowed.

@section Noteworthy changes in version @samp{0.10.1}

The art graphics module is the default now. As was previously the
case, if the proper libraries are not found, the configuration will
automatically switch to xlib on winlib (whichever is appropriate).

There was a great deal of work by Tom MacSween on the windows module to
get windows and taskbars working together, closing, opening, hiding, and just
general good window management.

The Cairo module has been significantly updated and now works with
Cariro version 1.0, although you need to make some minor changes to the
Cairo library before it will work with GNUstep. Due to this, this module
is still considered beta. Ask on the mailing lists for help with this.

@section Noteworthy changes in version @samp{0.10.0}

The installed name of the backend now includes an interface version number.
This avoids the potential version mismatch between the frontend (GUI) library
and the backend.

First release. Most components extracted from xgps. The old backends,
xgps and xdps were depreciated in favor of this new backend, simply named
back, which can be configured for a variety of window server and
graphics implementations, and also allow for improved code sharing.

In addition there is now a window server backend for Windows computers, 
although it is in a very alpha state.
